### Overview 

The booking and reservation system ER diagram encompasses entities like Users, Bookings, Reservations, Services/Items, and Payments. Users interact with the system to make bookings or reservations for various services or items, with each booking possibly comprising multiple reservations. Additionally, users can make payments for their bookings.

Key relationships include users being associated with multiple bookings, bookings being linked to reservations and services/items, and bookings being connected to payments. Attributes such as User ID, Name, Email, Booking ID, Date, Time, Service ID, Description, and Payment Amount are essential for defining and organizing data within the system.

This ER diagram serves as a visual representation of the system's structure, aiding in database design and the implementation of functionalities for managing bookings and reservations efficiently.
